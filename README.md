This set of scripts were created as part of the Kaggle competition regarding house prices.\

Raw training data: train_house.csv\
Raw testing data: test_house.csv

The scripts are separated into several sections:

1. Data Preparation: includes import, general dusting/clean up, imputation and encoding
3. Feature selection and Visualization
4. Model fitting and evaluation
5. Hyperparameters tuning
6. Final touches and scoring

For each section, a set of functions has been written.\
kaggleHouse.py is the main script that calls all the subsequent ones.
