This set of scripts were created as part of the Kaggle competition regarding house prices.

The scripts are separated into several sections:

1. Data import, general dusting/clean up, imputation and encoding
2. Feature selection and Data Visualization
3. Model fitting and evaluation
4. Hyperparameters tuning
5. Final touches and scoring

For each section, a script for each step has been written and uploaded to the respective location.
